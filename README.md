## Project Description:
In a nutshell, this assignment served a purpose of reinforcing the basics of how Version Control Systems work. More specifically, this project helped me thoroughly understand how Git functions as a user aid and how easy it is to learn/use.

## Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. A Version Control System is a tool that allows users to manage their files properly by knowing what changed were made, when they were made, who made the changes, and how to access/utilize specific versions of their projects.
2. A distributed VCS is ideal for a few reasons: there's always a backup repository (and additional security) in case one goes down, workflow in general is faster due to users working from their local machines, and there is no need to go to the hassle of creating/maintaining a main server.
3. In this lesson I also learned the basic Git functions, what actions they perform and the real meaning of those actions.
